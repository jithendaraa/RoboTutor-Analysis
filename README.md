# RoboTutor-Analysis

## Installation and Setup

1. This repo works with <a href="https://github.com/jithendaraa/hotDINA">hotDINA</a> to fit model parameters which has scripts to automatically extract RoboTutor-Analysis/Data (which has to be setup). After fitting, this repo obtains these parameters to update on logged data from usage of RoboTutor. The first step would be to create a project folder: ```mkdir project```
2. Clone this repo and the hotDINA repo inside the project folder. <br>
   ```
   cd project
   git clone https://github.com/jithendaraa/hotDINA
   git clone https://github.com/jithendaraa/RoboTutor-Analysis
   ```
